Note that Hill cipher is row major, while AES is column major. 
You do not have to use each of the functions in your main, the ones which you may need are:
Ceaser_Cipher(), Playfair_Cipher(), Hill_Cipher(), Vigenere_Cipher(), Vernam_Cipher(), AES(), and DES().
Note that the mode field in Vigenere_Cipher() is a boolean field, if it's set to true then the mode
is autokey, while if it's set to zero the mode is repetitive.
